to run services we need to install ==> npm i axios


for awesome-store-server data we need to include
 baseUrl='http://awesome-store-server.herokuapp.com/products' in catalogService.js



in src===>components==========> services==>CatalogService.js
also import import axios from 'axios';in CatalogService

axios.*() returns a promise object (promise is built-in class in JS - it was introduced in ES2015)
then() ==>// when backend succesfully returns the data
AND catch() ==> //when backend was not able to return the data
ARE 2 methods of promise object
